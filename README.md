### Hi there 

In addition to my job as a systems technician, I have also invested time and effort in developing my programming skills. During my free time, I have worked on personal projects using JavaScript and C#. These projects have allowed me to explore and learn more about the fascinating world of programming.

Additionally, I am beginning to focus on the field of cybersecurity.
